3. **Use the daily allowance feature**: Check your daily allowance on the dashboard to pace your spending throughout the month.

### Expense Tracking Habits

1. **Track expenses immediately**: Add expenses as soon as they occur for greater accuracy.

2. **Categorize properly**: Use consistent categories to get meaningful analysis.

3. **Add descriptions**: Provide descriptive notes for unusual expenses to help with future reference.

### Data Management

1. **Export regularly**: Back up your data at least once a month.

2. **Check your data**: Review the Analysis page periodically to identify spending patterns and areas for improvement.
